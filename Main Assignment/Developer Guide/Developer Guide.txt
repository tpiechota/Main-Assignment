II. CONTENT
===========
 - Developer Guide folder - developer guide
 - doc folder - Javadoc
 - Logging Tool:
	+ package: Com.kylegoslin
	+ class files:
		* StartUp.java
		* LogHandler.java 
		* XmlFormatter.java
		* package-info.java (part of Javadoc documentation containing information about the package)


III. INSTALLATION
=================
 1. Copy the whole package "Com.kylegoslin" with its contents and paste it into your project folder. It will not work outside your java project folder containing classes which are to be tested using the logging tool.
 ex.:
 
 CORRECT:
 --------
a)	My Project
		|
		|_src1
		  |
		  |_Com.kylegoslin
		  |
		  |_package1
		  |
		  |_package2

b)	My Project
		|
		|_src1
		| |_package1
		|
		|_src2
		| |_package2
		|
		|_src3
		  |_Com.kylegoslin
			
 WRONG:
 ------
	My Project_1
		|
		|_src
		  |
		  |_package1
		  |
		  |_package2

	My Project_2
		|
		|_src
		  |
		  |_Com.kylegoslin
		  

 2. Copy this block of code at the beginning of you testing class "Constructor"
 
	/*** Logger Initiator - BEGIN ***/
	/* This line has to be added to testing class for the Logger to work correctly! */
	Com.kylegoslin.StartUp.config(this.getClass().getName().toString(), this.getClass().getPackage().getName().toString());
	/*** Logger Initiator - END ***/
	
	Important: If you paste this block of code into your "static void main" method you will get error and the logger won't work. You can't use this block of code in a static context!
		
 ex.:
	public class ExampleUsage_1 {
		...
		public ExampleUsage_1(){	

			/*** Logger Initiator - BEGIN ***/
			/* This line has to be added to testing class for the Logger to work correctly! */
			Com.kylegoslin.StartUp.config(this.getClass().getName().toString(), this.getClass().getPackage().getName().toString());
			/*** Logger Initiator - END ***/
			
			exampleMethod();
			
		}
		...
		
		
IV. OTHER INFORMATION
=====================
 1. Log files are saved in the project folder. Every log file is saved as a separate file. Name of each file contains date and time when the file was created. This way every file has a unique and meaningful name.
	ex.:
		Log_03052012204356GMT.txt -> Log_ date(dd-mm-yyyy) time(hh:mm:ss) zone(GMT) .txt
		Log_03052012204356GMT.xml -> Log_ date(dd-mm-yyyy) time(hh:mm:ss) zone(GMT) .xml

		
 2. Logger records messages containing information:
		- bugId
		- message: 
		- millis: time in milliseconds (epoch time)
		- level: message level (SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, etc.)
		- method: method name
		- class: class name
		- package: package name
